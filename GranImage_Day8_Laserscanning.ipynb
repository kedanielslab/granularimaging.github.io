    "The underlying principle is to use *transparent particles* in an *index-matched medium* to *visualize the locations* of all particles in a 3D system. This is typically done by providing some color-contrast between the particles using a *dye*, and scaning a *laser sheet* through the system to create a 3D stack of images. Today, we will go through each of these five pieces uses mostly household/Amazon materials. This will allow us to examine each of the design choices that would be made in optimizing a more precise apparatus, including the interactions between these choices. \n",

    "Today, we will use hydrogel beads (of the same type used for flower-arranging or dispersing room scents) as our experimental system. In addition to being inexpensive, they come pre-dyed and have a low index of refraction, making them easy to index-match. These are shipped as mm-sized hard spheres, and swell overnight in water to cm-sized soft spheres. Since they are almostly entirely water (once swelled) it is also easy to density-match if that is desirable. Note that salts in the solution will change their size (and stiffness), not just provide density or index matching. We will examine such scenarios below.\n",

    "Fluorescent dye molecules absorb higher-energy (shorter wavelenth) light, and emit lower-energy (longer-wavelength) light. Therefore, to use a fluorescent setup, you would also nee also need to purchase of set of optical filters which allow you to filter the excitation light so that it isn't detected as part of the emitted light. And you also need to match the wavelength of your laser to be as close as possible to the absorption peak. \n",
